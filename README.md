# event_eaze
Suite group project app for WDI McClane

EventEaze is an app designed to provide a convenient way to search for all kinds of local events in your area!
Not only will you be able to search for events, but also for local restaurants and bars to visit before or after your fun Event!
Save these events to our database to revisit them anytime you want!!

Directions
1. To start this process please select a city.  Any City! As long as it exists on earth and has some kind of social scene!
2. Put in a timeframe!  You can search for times like Today, this week, this month, all, and future!
3.  If you know what kind of event you are looking for, please feel free to put in a keyword!  Keywords can be as general as music to something as descriptive as knitting!
4.  Take a moment to bask in the glory of these custom search results courtesy of the Eventful API.  
5. Feel free to click more info to see a more detailed description of the event.  Watch out for html tags tho!  When you get your fill of the description click close to hide the modal view.
6. Once you see an event that you would like to attend click the save event and show bars button!
7. Viola! A list of great bars near your events venue!  How convenient!
8. Scroll through the list of bars to find one that fits your taste.  Maybe multiple bars do!?  Feel free to save as many bars to your event as you would like.
9.  Congratulations!  You have succesfully planned a night out.  
10.  To see the history of your saved events click the show saved events button.  A list of all your events will populate the left side of the screen.
11. Click the map it button to view the bars in relation to your event right in google maps!  
12. We hope our app helps you discover some great events and plan some fun nights out with friends!
